## Hi there, I'm Ari! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate of UC San Diego with a B.S. in Ecology, Behavior and Evolution and a minor in Marine Science. Currently, I'm looking to gain work experience in wildlife conservation with a non-profit, state, or federal institution before I pursue an M.S.

I have experience managing, analyzing, and visualizing biology data in Python, R, and ArcGIS. I've co-authored a research paper on bats, created a mesopelagic food web graphic in R for a poster presentation, and created a web map and story map to share fruit tree locations, to name some projects I've worked on. I'm eager to apply what I've learned to future projects and learn new things!
